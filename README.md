# awesome-blockchain-glossary 
🚧 A not-so-serious compilation of blockchain jargons explained in the most ridiculous ways.

## Description
The blockchain world right now is a hot bowl of funny looking words. Funny looking words with really long boring terse meaning. I find it easy to understand a concept if it is explained with `everyday things`and `Analogies`. This hopes to serve as a lubricant to ease new blockchain devs into the ecosystem. I hope it matters.

## Usage
### Are you learning blockchain concepts?
❇️ Good! Then you are perfect. Use the search feature in your browser to find what ever term you need to understand. Get the good stuff without the metal buried in.

✨ Wait, hold up! If you are learning blockchain development, you could also contribute to this project no matter what level of lesson you are. Look at the contribution guidline, or as i like to refer to it `The Onboarding station`, for easy steps to do this.
