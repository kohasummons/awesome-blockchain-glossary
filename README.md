# awesome-blockchain-glossary

🚧 A not-so-serious compilation of blockchain jargons explained in the most ridiculous and simple way.

## Description

The blockchain world right now is a hot bowl of funny looking words. Funny looking words with really long convulated and terse meaning. I find it easy to understand a concept if it is explained with `everyday things`and `Analogies`. This hopes to serve as a lubricant to ease new blockchain devs into the ecosystem. I hope it matters.

Please, give this project a star ⭐. It is free.
